Ryan spent some time growing up in the Bay Area and we returned to SF in 2013.

Being avid travelers who frequently used hotels and tried a different homesharing site, those experiences did not compare to the TLC we received when staying with family and friends. We realized that adding little touches like family artwork, a welcome kit with snacks, wine, fresh flowers from our yard (when in season) and a stockpile of toiletries in case anything didn't make its way into your suitcase, makes an ordinary place to lay your head a welcoming retreat.

We are both college-educated professionals. We enjoy finding local restaurants, making fun meals at home, exploring our city, and working in the yard.

As a same-sex couple, we understand the need for inclusive accommodations when we travel. We promote an inclusive environment for guests regardless of race, color, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, or age. 

When we're traveling, Ryan is usually looking for great running routes and I'm looking for great golf courses to play. Together, we seek out delicious local restaurants, warm beaches, and activities that give us a greater sense of local culture.

I'm from South Africa and lived in Tokyo, Japan before moving to San Francisco over 25 years ago. I gave up my Business Development career in 2016 to focus full-time on short-term rentals. 

I have traveled to 50+ countries and stayed at some amazing places. I know what a difference great hospitality can make. I thus strive to create an experience at Standout Stays that will be memorable and unique. My aim is that you will come back and stay at our properties again each time you are back in the area.   

As a guest, I am responsible, trustworthy, and neat. Being a host myself, I can completely put myself in your shoes and am very respectful of your space. I love AirBNB because it affords one the opportunity to live like a local when you travel to a new area.  

I enjoy spending time with my dog (Dexter), working out, hiking, skiing, and generally making the most of life.   

If you are considering booking one of our listings, I know you will love your stay!  And for more information about our company, just search for us.

Hope to meet you soon,

I am that wanderer, incredibly lucky to be infected with the passion and audacity to travel often and solo. 
I was born and raised in San Francisco. I am a native. I love my city. IÃ¢â¬â¢ve watched it evolve. But I have also left it many times in my youth. IÃ¢â¬â¢ve left it to study abroad in France. Best decision of my college life! I backpacked solo around western Europe. 
IÃ¢â¬â¢ve left SF when I was in the military and stationed around our country. IÃ¢â¬â¢ve also driven as far north as Niagara Falls.
Career wise, IÃ¢â¬â¢ve spent over a decade in property management and rentals. I'm also a realtor. As a hobby, I write as often as possible, a pen and notebook on me at all times.
I am cursed with this blessing of being unceasingly interested in people. I love meeting people. I love hearing stories. And I love writing them. 
As I review my lifeÃ¢â¬â¢s experiences, IÃ¢â¬â¢ve come upon one very simple realization, that proclaimed secret of success. It is merely this: Ã¢â¬ËSay what you will do and do what you will say.Ã¢â¬â¢
